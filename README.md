# Strilled-Flux
A modification of the Redstone Flux API for make it compatible with Strilling

Credits to CoFH to make this API and the Helium Team for helping me with some stuff


This API is used for the Strilling Mod. If you want to use energy storage, use Forge Energy (FE) or the original redstone flux API
